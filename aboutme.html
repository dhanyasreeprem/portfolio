      <h1> Welcome to my page! </h1>
      <p> Hi! I am Dhanya. I am a rising junior in Cupertino High School. I am passionate about Computer Science and Astronomy. I am an avid hacker and programmer. I am involved in many other activities outside of school such as dance and music. I actively participate in FBLA and Speech and Debate. Learning has been my passion and I strive to learn more skills and make this world a better place with the use of computer science. Recently I got involved in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing and I plan to work on more projects intergrating ML and Astronomy. Hope you enjoy my website!</p>

        <h2>Dance</h2>
        <p> I love dancing. It helps me get out of the school clutter. I have been dancing for 8 years and I love every bit about dancing.</p>
