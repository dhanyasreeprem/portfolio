            <p> Hi! I am Dhanya. I am a rising junior in Cupertino High School. I am passionate about Computer Science and Astronomy. I am an avid hacker and programmer. I am involved in many other activities outside of school such as dance and music. I actively participate in FBLA and Speech and Debate. Learning has been my passion and I strive to learn more skills and make this world a better place with the use of computer science. Recently I got involved in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing and I plan to work on more projects intergrating ML and Astronomy. Hope you enjoy my website!<p>
